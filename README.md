# qtproj1

Normally Swing is used for java desktop applications but I have used Qt Jambi here to build is simple pathprocessor desktop GUI application that takes in a system path and displays all the directories and files uder that directory. 

Qt simplifies the process of building desktop apps and the aesthetics are better than swing. 

Just import the files into an IDE and do a gradle build. Then run the artifact from console.
